It is ... `description of Animusic`.

Folks like 3b1b already do this on a very advanced educational level for way more complex mathematical concepts. For free.

- I'm scared to delve into a program
- An AST in my head evaporates faster than alcohol in a frying pan on the sun
- why do these guys make it harder than it already is?
- technology came such a long way and yet we are scared to make visual debuggers?
  - why do people want to sound like elites saying jargon
  - and when we do, we stop to soon, being proud of having atleast something. I'm sure our shining genius can come up with something better.
  - climbing is hard, but unlearning and coming to thevlevel of learners is harder
- teachers are important
  - sidequesting and helping rather than a race, everything's a race
- Not just animation but the storyboard too
  - I remember sweety ma'am and other teachers trying to explain DP on the _blackboard_, painstaking drawing out every pass through.
  - I understand frisction is good for have lasting learning in the brain. But you need to have a taste or a birdseye view to be motivated in the first place. And I'm not taking all friction away, just the one for the first part. You'll still have to practice, but now you'll have more hotspots in you brain for that learning to latch.
- The importance of exploring Error Space to really grok Edge Cases: not all mistakes are useless, they just go into another problem domain (variations)
- mathematics is imp, this is just a supplement
- programming is hard but I don't want it to be hard for the wrong reasons.

- and the anger of this being a very unnecessary _artificial_ hurdle, like the process of job applications
- This is not Leetcode. It is just a tiny toy.
- Just putting shape on something that's already there: an AST. - `Interesting times`

- Programs always execute behind my back. So I ask it to lay it all out right under my nose.
- Like if I write a program to uncompress a string:
  - I want it to show what's happening
  - But also be able to go back at any point in the program
  - And see it all laid out
- And go to other programs ...
  - maybe on the same island
    - see the townhall/library of this island summrizing the relations of every
  - or a different island
  -
- Or may entire other scary islands like function portals or deja vu time loops (WIP)

Soemthing akin to js in 14 minutes

- See the _very_ limited pool of problems in this PoC. I'll work to add others as I can. Contibutions welcome!

  - personal project Made it for me, if it helps even one other folk I'd be glad :)

More programs being worked upon! Hope to cover as many as I can.
I feel studying/puzzling over new programs like this is very educational.
Very much WIP, still in active development and ask for feedback
Is see if this is something that I should work on getting
cleaner, if not helping solve CS homework problems too.
It will be very slow as I also have a day job.
Some things I'd like to do...

Quite a few amazing products out there to teach DSAs, this is not to replace any of them. This is not meant to be anything like leetcode. It's a mechnical toy, just educational, akin to a pop up card, or a book of pop-up cards (which I love to make), interactive, editable but not writable/storage.
